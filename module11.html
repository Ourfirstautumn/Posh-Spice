  <p> In our SCRUM team my main questions were a lot of “does this even work” or “how do you think this looks on your computer? Go check”. It was my time for usability testing, really. Casey and Marcus were a big help. They both use Macs while I use PCs so just that in itself was very useful for testing. But they were good about offering up ideas about how to change little aspects of my site to make it prettier. Also, Marcus is a genius at finding where things go wrong in coding so he helped me troubleshoot a lot.</p>
	<p>To my group members it was a lot of feedback about the layout and looks of their portfolio. They both wanted my opinion on how to make their sites more visually appealing. It was a lot of deciding on whether colors worked or if navigation was easy enough. Outside of class, I helped Casey with a lot of Photoshop stuff as well as coding so I count that as part of my SCRUM.</p>
	<p>We only had so much time, so I made sure to ask more detailed questions as well so that I could fix them quickly right in front of my team. Then I could use the rest of the class period to make changes and get immediate feedback on how they looked. It was a lot of repeating that process for the two days so I could get a lot done in a short period of time.</p>
	<p>I set goals to get feedback on things I could immediately fix. I also wanted to get my about page and my contact page finished. With help from my SCRUM team it was easy to find ways to complete both of these pages. I got everything done within the SCRUM time that I wanted to get done.</p>
  <p>For anything else that I needed help on that my SCRUM team couldn’t help with, I either googled it or went to W3schools. This helped me through basic problems in my coding. But because I went bit by bit, so VERY slowly, I could usually find errors in the code very easily. I really did not have many problems creating this portfolio when it came down to it.</p>
