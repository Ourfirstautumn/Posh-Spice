  <p> My HTML compared to my CSS is dry bones. In my HTML, all I have are tags, ids, and a href links to create “button” images. Frankly, without the CSS, my HTML would NOT work. The CSS contains all of the page spacing, image sizing, images in general, and basically the entire nav bar. So if my CSS file for some reason gets lost, I am done for. This means I’ve successfully managed to separate the content and presentation.</p>
	<p>Up until now, I literally could not get everything I needed for the page to function to reasonably fit in the HTML. It was a mess when I started off trying to do that. Therefore, I’ve come up with a system of breaking up each of my pages into parts. I put the components in the HTML then proceed to alter EVERYTHING about them in the CSS. Height, width, position, background, et cetera. Each part has its own ID which helps me easily find it in the CSS.</p>
	<p>I’m honestly not sure where the shortcomings are in my markup. I guess the biggest weakness is, as I said earlier, if the CSS isn’t functioning I’m done for. I don’t know how I can change that though, seeing as I’m supposed to have presentation and content separate.</p>
	<p>Going forward, I am leaving this major in favor of one in which I shouldn’t be doing any of this again. But, if for some reason, I do need to do code a website, or anything else, I’ll be following the same process I did for coding this one. It will mean once again working bit by bit to create the HTML and CSS side-by-side. This will keep everything separate and ensure they work together to create an optimal running site.</p>
